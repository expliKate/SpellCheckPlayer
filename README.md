# SpellCheckPlayer is a simple tool to help designers select an appropriate Levenshtein distance for a spellchecker by allowing them to play with different values and terms.

# This project may or may not be expanded depending on my needs. One possible expansion would be to allow for more than one spellcheck at a time and/or enable some kind of batch-checking.
